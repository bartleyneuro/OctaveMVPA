*** 1.0

 - Reorganized directory structure.

 - Removed add_struct_fields, which is deprecated.  

 - Added "mergestructs" to replace add_struct_fields, which merges two
   structures and has exactly the same behavior. add_struct_fields
   should not be used for parsing arguments anymore.

 - Changed all train_* functions to use PROPVAL.

 - Added add_mvpa_paths.m to add all necessary paths, rather than
   requiring the user to enter them by hand.
 
 - Deprecated 'get_funct_handle_name', is now 'arg2funct'. 

 - Added searchlight functionality:
    - statmap_searchlight
    - statmap_classify
    - statmap_glm_multiv  

 - Removed "tutorial_hard.m"
 
 - Added function ISCATEGORICAL -- like check_1ofn_regressors.m, but
   it checks both binary, "1ofn" style classification regressors, and
   single row "desireds" vectors. This was to get wavestrapping to
   work; in the next release, we'll formalize the behavior of
   categorical and continuous labels.

 - Added wavestrapping

*** 0.9

write_to_afni now uses zeroify by default
  
  argument DO_ZEROIFY renamed to ONLY_DO_ZEROIFY

  argument RUNS renamed to RUNSNAME

write_to_afni can now write out multiple volumes, and use
views other than +orig (though that's the default)

added statmap_3dDeconvolve

create_xvalid_odds_and_evens???

feature_select can optionally pass in extra timepoints

statmap_searchlight

statmap_classify

average_object

*** 0.7.1 051103, rev ???

Updated tutorial_easy documentation about 1-of-n warning

Added download logging page (thanks to RT)

Duplicate_object can now deal with objects stored on the HD

Average_object excludes rest

Updated the manual section

Renamed shift_TRs to shift_trs



*** 0.7, 051024, rev 724

Started work on unit test suite - not included yet

Added home-grown anova1_mvpa and zscore_mvpa so things should pretty much
work without any extra toolboxes. Updated manual and tutorial
accordingly.

Added progress/mlint.txt so that people can spot any issues that mlint
has picked up.

Took m2html out of the SVN, though it *should* still be part of the
tarball

Changed cross-validation so that it can now take in a group of
patterns (e.g. for PCA, where the components will be different for
each voxel selection iteration)

Added various functionality to write_to_afni and load_afni_pattern
(e.g. load specific sub-briks only)

Changed duplicate_object arguments so that it takes
'transfer_group_name' as an optional propval argument

Fixed issues with passing statmap_arg to statmap functions, cv_args
to classifier functions and perfmet_args to perfmet functions.

Fixed small bug with the way set_mat dealt with objects that have been
moved to the HD (thanks to MKC)

Added functionality for parallelising the statmaps across a cluster

Added various accessor functions to make life easier,
e.g. change_objgroup, initset_object

Added average_object and create_blocklabels to deal with averaging

Optimized summarize a little bit. Still could do with further
improvements

Minor changes to perfmet_maxclass and train_bp

Improved propval - added optional arguments capabilities to it. Could
do with tidying up

Added create_sorted_mask as a complement to create_thresh_mask

Create_thresh_mask appends the thresh to the end of the maskname

Fixed bug in get_type so that it checks for accidental
plural/uppercase forms of the type




*** 0.6.1 - 050908
Minor changes to tutorial_easy.htm to fix the new lowercase
load_afni_pattern.m and load_afni_mask.m.

Also fixed the call to cross_validation.m so that class_args is the
last argument, and so that it uses train_ and test_funct_name in the
class_args - thanks to Ronnie Bryan

Fixed teeny bug in set_objsubfield.m so that ignore_empty is now
args.ignore_empty as it should be

Ran mlint to fix any bugs with sprintf, variables that don't get used
etc. Also changed all the 'exist' calls to use two arguments, all the
and and or to be short-circuit versions (i.e. && and ||)

Added Chris Moore's 'Dude, where's my voxel?' section to the manual

Added Ehren Newman's trainscg suggestions



*** 0.6 - 050906
Many manual changes and slight code tweaks



*** IMPLEMENTED CHANGES SINCE 25 AUG 05 - became 0.5
