*** high-priority

see Ryan Mruczek's SVM suggestions


= Version 1.1 To Do =

== Conceptual ==

 * Changing the way we talk about "regressors": now they're "labels", and they're "categorical" (1-of-n, classification), or "continuous" (regression).
 * Changing the way we talk about feature selection: now we use {{{feature_calc}}}, and we talk about {{{statmap}}}, {{{dimred}}} or matrix-only {{{calc}}} operations to perform on features.
 * Changing the way we nest functions, now using {{{propval}}} (e.g. statmap_searchlight, cross_validation). Remove all references to add_struct_fields.
 
== Documentation ==

 * Update the "What's New" documentation page.
 * Update the manual, existing tutorials, .m files and glossary to reflect new terminology and procedures.

== Programming ==

 * Change the subj functions to use "labels" in addition to "regressors" to access.
 * Add feature_calc and feature_calc_searchlight.
 * Improvements to cross_validation:
   * Better handling of arguments.
   * Training error in addition to test error.
   * Better handling of patterns with rest/no rest (i.e. checking timepoints after selection.)
 * Add utility function mvpa2mat.

== Functionality == 

 * dimensionality reduction
 * BV importing/exporting
 * anatomical masking (put masks for this on web)
 * improved view montage


*** high-priority

get rid of mean_ignore_nans etc. just replace with
nanmean. does nanmean exist in earlier versions of matlab???

tidy up the unit tests

  fix the tests in tests/broken

  stop unit_hd_scripts.m from littering the tests/ directory
  with temporary directories

  update the oldtest* tests

*** high-priority
we should use fisher's z-transform to average multiple correlation 
cross-validation perfmets.
we should have a non-default option to weight each run according 
to its nTimepoints

*** low-priority
find supergraph_significance.m so that unit_wavestrapper_results.m works

*** low-priority
tutorial on averaging

*** low-priority
move AMALGAMATE_RESULTS_CONTEXT5.M into mvpa/core/learn or util

note that

  shift_regressors.m has changed its default REGSNAME

  convolve_regressors_afni.m has changed its default
  REGSNAME for thresholded ('%s_convt' instead of
  '%s_conv_thr')

*** low-priority
create a mechanism for dummy variables, e.g. the patname in statmap_3dDeconvolve

*** low-priority
add adaboost_mkc to the distribution.
move mvpa/boosting into mvpa/contrib/learn/boostexter

*** high-priority
add Brodmann mask generation stuff to next release

  add mattheww's predefined Brodmann briks as a separate download

*** high-priority
look into getting the SVM working. see emails from Ryan
Moore (e.g. 070803)

*** high-priority
statmap_3dDeconvolve

  check out new afni 3dDeconvolve/3dSynthesize
  functionality. have they fixed the all-zeros-in-a-run
  bug??? see email from sara 070625

*** high-priority
fix create_xvalid_oddeven. doesn't seem to include actives in the second iteration

*** low-priority
set_objfield should automatically call add_created to add created field, rather than giving the user an admonishment

*** high-priority docs
check whether jarrod updated the tutorial to reflect that
fcdf is missing

*** high-priority docs
fix all the links in wiki

*** high-priority packaging
include all the pat-to-mask, and mask-to-coords functions in internal

  rename functions mask_from_map etc. to make them more guessable???

  need a way of creating a volume from a pattern
  (e.g. convert_pat_to_vol.m). we'll need this if we want to
  write 4D patterns-with-time back to AFNI, for instance

*** high-priority packaging
tidy up the internal directory

*** high-priority docs
tutorial reading recommendations

*** low-priority
borda count performance metric???

  see Mitchell et al (2004) for their ranking metric???

brain and masking them out, to show how to use some of the
masking and indexing functions

*** low-priority
update documentation to deal with when your conditions aren't balanced across runs

*** low-priority
have write_to_afni count the nargout and return a subj, just to avoid confusion

*** low-priority
amalgamate michael bannert's scripts. see email 070625

  update the ridge function, using mbannert's
  train_ridge_denis_optim.m - see conversation - Michael
  Bannert - 070615

*** low-priority
getme.m = a function that runs evalin on '%s = get_mat(subj,guess_this,''%s'');'

  asked the matlab newsgroup about adding in tab completion

*** high-priority
try ziad's new, more efficient, BrikLoad

*** low-priority
add a 'designing a classifier experiment' section to the manual
  - every run should contain all conditions
  - if possible, have an ABBA design to your runs, so there are no obvious trends
  - avoid fast event-related?
  - TR-lock your stimuli
  - have 8s blank at the beginning, and 10s blank at the end

*** low-priority
get the unit tests working

*** low-priority
view_montage burps in an inscrutable way if you have multiple sub-briks. it should ask the user which sub-brik to use

*** low-priority
fix catherine chang view_montage bugs

*** low-priority
incorporate david weiss' new view_montage code

*** low-priority
create_pattern_from_mask should fail if the new mask contains voxels outside the original pattern. it should suggest running intersect_pattern_from_mask first

*** low-priority
store condition breakdown in the results structure (confusion etc.)

*** low-priority
change_objgroup should check that you don't have an object and a group of the same name

  or maybe set _objfield should do it

  and it shouldn't allow you to put things into groups if they already are a group

*** low-priority
see whether the F stat has moved in the BRIK

  see http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/misc/Decon/DeconSpring2007.html

  is censortr on top of the censor file argument???

*** low-priority
if you try and get_mat an object that exists called 'pattern','regressors','selector','mask', it seems to automatically give you an error, regardless of whether there is in fact an object of that name

*** low-priority
add goforit option to statmap_3dDeconvolve

  see conversation - Chris Moore - Michael Bannert - 070404

*** low-priority
try francisco's crossval/spheres code

*** low-priority
make the mvpa_support archives public

*** low-priority

add these to the mvpa documentation

  change write_to_afni so that it checks if the pattern has
  a masked_by field
  
  figure out how to get the 3D pattern repn
  
    my_mask = get_mat(subj,'mask','my_mask');
  
    idx = find(my_mask);
  
    my_pat = get_mat(subj,'pattern','my_pat');
  
    pat3d = my_mask;
    pat3d(idx) = my_pat;
  
  figure out how to get the 4D pattern repn
  
    pat4d = my_mask;
    pat4d = repmat(pat4d,[1 1 1 nTimepoints]); % untested
  
    % v slow/lame way of doing things
    % also untested
    for t=1:nTimepoints
      pat3d = zeros(size(pat3d));
      pat3d(idx) = my_pat(:,t);
      pat4d(:,:,:,t) = pat3d;
    end


*** low-priority
whittle_pattern should be destructive, but it should back up
the pattern first. that way, i could run it on any dataset
and it would allow me to test functions without having them
take pattern name arguments. it will probably have to mess
with the mask too

*** low-priority
add some info about dealing with out of memory errors when loading patterns

*** low-priority
look into klaus nuissl's load_spm and other functions

*** low-priority
fix create_xvalid_indices sanity check so that it only warns
for jumbled runs

*** low-priority
make convolve_regressors..., 3dDeconvolve etc. put their
output scripts into separate directories, rather than littering 
the home directory

*** low-priority
deal with writing zipped BRIK files

*** low-priority
would it be easier if feature-select actually created the 
pat and regs using the selectors, and then the statmaps 
just took in matrices?

*** low-priority
afni smoothing

*** low-priority
try Ziad's new_head function

*** low-priority
use solution from ConversationZiadSaad070131 to get sub-brik names

*** low-priority
make zeroify_write_to_afni the default

*** low-priority
write import and export scripts for nifti

*** low-priority
stop using fcdf.m as part of anova1_mvpa - see jarrod email
070131

*** low-priority
discuss what preprocessing to do. don't detrend before GLM.
different kinds of zscoring???

*** low-priority
add nfirst argument to 3dDeconvolve to exclude the first few
timepoints

*** low-priority
add censor-nfirst argument to create_xvalid_indices to
ignore a few timepoints from the beginning of each run

*** low-priority
add baseline visualization scripts

*** low-priority
look into nested N-1 cross-validation frameworks for setting parameters using the training data

*** low-priority
perhaps cross-validation could be told to run its training
and testing multiple times per iteration, and then average
the outputs, before calculating the performance metric

*** low-priority
cross-validation should not include runs that yield NaNs when calculating average performance

*** low-priority
compare_size should be able to take in >2 variables

*** low-priority
create_xvalid_indices should maybe notice when you create an iteration with no testing TRs, and just scrub it from the n-1

*** low-priority
ridge should take in a penalty-factor argument (can't set at the same time as current penalty)

*** low-priority
ridge should automatically do a grid search

*** low-priority
make anova p vs f value a required argument too

*** low-priority
rewrite 1-of-n regressors so it's more informative

*** low-priority
add good practices to wiki
  - lower case
  - dbstop if warning
  - contiguous groups
  - no groups same name as objects
  - be careful when duplicating objects with special fields
  - move things to the hd
  - do it all in one big subj

  - multiple conditions per run
  - same number of TRs per condition
  - more than two conditions

*** low-priority
write a section on 'improving moderate classification performance'


*** low-priority
you could create an expand_struct function, that would take
in a struct, loop over the fields, and use assignin to put
all those fields into the caller workspace
then, if you ran:

  expand_struct(propval(varargin,defaults))

  you'd end up all the args as local first-level variables
  (rather than stuck inside an args struct)

*** low-priority
create a mat-only thresh_mask function for use in
create_thresh_mask, view_montage, compare_statmaps etc.

*** low-priority
if propval returns an empty unused argument, make sure it's
a cell array

*** low-priority
create an 'aux' directory for auxiliary non-mvpa scripts,
like propval, rows, cols etc.

*** low-priority
talk to michael and ziad about a debian afni package

*** low-priority
rename the trunk/mvpa directory to trunk/core

*** low-priority
update tutorial to incorporate view_montage, and wholebrain

*** low-priority
create a generic test for univariate feature selection
algorithms (maybe separately for regression and
classification), analogous to the generic classifier test

*** low-priority

figure out a way to ensure that the masked_by mask has the
same number of voxels as in the pattern

  currently, set_objfield and initset_object don't check

*** low-priority

link to the django design philosophies

  http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/design_philosophies/

*** low-priority

initset_object shouldn't allow creation of a group with same
name as a pattern

*** low-priority
improve all check_1ofn messages

*** low-priority
check for afni matlab library updates

*** low-priority
write_to_afni needs to check for whether a pattern has an
associated masked_by field

*** low-priority
optimize summarize.m

  it should break down the selectors into 0s/1s/2s

  summarize should display which optional arguments it
  doesn't recognise, and advise about optional arguments to
  get rid of that warning (maybe)

*** low-priority
make the toolbox deal with both singular and plural forms of the
objtypes

*** low-priority
add checks to zscore so that it looks for single-condition runs
